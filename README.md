class is a blueprint of an object.
class contains attributes and methods
attribute - variable that is attached to class
method - function that is attached to class

to add attribute to class, use the dot(.) notation for example: user.username = "smith"

constructor is part of the blueprint that allows us to especify what should happen, when our object is being constructed. this is also known as initializing. 
when object is being inititalized when can se variables to their starting values

the init function is going to be called everytime you create a new object from it's class
